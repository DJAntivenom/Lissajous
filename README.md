# Lissajous
A little depiction of lissajous curves.

This little program was created because of this video <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--6eyLO78CY</a>.
It is programmed in pure Java using a combination of the swing and awt libraries.

I know that the foldername is spelled incorrectly ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )
